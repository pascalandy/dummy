Form follows fucking function. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Form follows fucking function. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Think about all the fucking possibilities.

The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display.

Intuition is fucking important. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother?

Think about all the fucking possibilities. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Don’t worry about what other people fucking think.

Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. You are not your fucking work. You are not your fucking work. Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. Someday is not a fucking day of the week.
